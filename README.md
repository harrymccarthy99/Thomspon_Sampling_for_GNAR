This repository contains code that implements Thompson Sampling to perform a network search aimed at optimising the GNAR predictive accuracy objective function.

The primary objective is to utilise Thompson Sampling to identify edges that, when added to an arbitrary network, result in the greatest average improvement in predictive accuracy. 

Taking the best performing edges on average is our proposed strategy to produce an optimised network
